This program aims to help with my Linear Algebra for finding determinants of a nxn matrix with co-factor expansion. It helps me to verify homework answers and can hopefully help you.

Features:
  Finding determinants & minors of any size matrix.
  
Upcoming:
  Finding inverses of any size matrix (I just haven't learned that yet ðŸ™‚).
